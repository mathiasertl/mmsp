In this paper, we gave a comprehensive overview of the \cpm{}. We gave an
historic overview, starting with its military roots. A short glossary is
provided to give the reader a quick overview and enable the reader to easily
understand the following chapters.

In chapter 2, we describe the Critical Path Method and the preparations that lead to it in
detail. It also gives a small insight into the many things that have to be
considered when correctly applying the \cpm{}. Examples of problems that occur in
the real world are given here as well. Chapter 3 explains the mathematical
background and gives examples of how to apply the \cpm{}. Chapter 4 gives
possible improvements (many in real-world usage today) to the \cpm{}. It turns
out that the \cpm{} is a good model but greatly benefits from further
improvement. Chapter 5 gives a comprehensive list of advandages and
disadvantages of the \cpm{}. Chapter 6 gives an overview over the many tools
